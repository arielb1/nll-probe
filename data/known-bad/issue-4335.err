{"message":"closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `v`, which is owned by the current function (Ast)","code":{"code":"E0373","explanation":"\nThis error occurs when an attempt is made to use data captured by a closure,\nwhen that data may no longer exist. It's most commonly seen when attempting to\nreturn a closure:\n\n```compile_fail,E0373\nfn foo() -> Box<Fn(u32) -> u32> {\n    let x = 0u32;\n    Box::new(|y| x + y)\n}\n```\n\nNotice that `x` is stack-allocated by `foo()`. By default, Rust captures\nclosed-over data by reference. This means that once `foo()` returns, `x` no\nlonger exists. An attempt to access `x` within the closure would thus be\nunsafe.\n\nAnother situation where this might be encountered is when spawning threads:\n\n```compile_fail,E0373\nfn foo() {\n    let x = 0u32;\n    let y = 1u32;\n\n    let thr = std::thread::spawn(|| {\n        x + y\n    });\n}\n```\n\nSince our new thread runs in parallel, the stack frame containing `x` and `y`\nmay well have disappeared by the time we try to use them. Even if we call\n`thr.join()` within foo (which blocks until `thr` has completed, ensuring the\nstack frame won't disappear), we will not succeed: the compiler cannot prove\nthat this behaviour is safe, and so won't let us do it.\n\nThe solution to this problem is usually to switch to using a `move` closure.\nThis approach moves (or copies, where possible) data into the closure, rather\nthan taking references to it. For example:\n\n```\nfn foo() -> Box<Fn(u32) -> u32> {\n    let x = 0u32;\n    Box::new(move |y| x + y)\n}\n```\n\nNow that the closure has its own copy of the data, there's no need to worry\nabout safety.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/ariel/Rust/rust-master/src/test/compile-fail/issue-4335.rs","byte_start":593,"byte_end":594,"line_start":16,"line_end":16,"column_start":21,"column_end":22,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    id(Box::new(|| *v))","highlight_start":21,"highlight_end":22}],"label":"`v` is borrowed here","suggested_replacement":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/home/ariel/Rust/rust-master/src/test/compile-fail/issue-4335.rs","byte_start":589,"byte_end":591,"line_start":16,"line_end":16,"column_start":17,"column_end":19,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    id(Box::new(|| *v))","highlight_start":17,"highlight_end":19}],"label":"may outlive borrowed value `v`","suggested_replacement":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"to force the closure to take ownership of `v` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/ariel/Rust/rust-master/src/test/compile-fail/issue-4335.rs","byte_start":589,"byte_end":591,"line_start":16,"line_end":16,"column_start":17,"column_end":19,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    id(Box::new(|| *v))","highlight_start":17,"highlight_end":19}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"move ||","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":null}
