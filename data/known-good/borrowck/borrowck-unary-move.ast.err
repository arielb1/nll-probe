{"message":"cannot move out of `x` because it is borrowed","code":{"code":"E0505","explanation":"\nA value was moved out while it was still borrowed.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0505\nstruct Value {}\n\nfn eat(val: Value) {}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = Value{};\n    {\n        let _ref_to_val: &Value = &x;\n        eat(x);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere, the function `eat` takes the ownership of `x`. However,\n`x` cannot be moved because it was borrowed to `_ref_to_val`.\nTo fix that you can do few different things:\n\n* Try to avoid moving the variable.\n* Release borrow before move.\n* Implement the `Copy` trait on the type.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nstruct Value {}\n\nfn eat(val: &Value) {}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = Value{};\n    {\n        let _ref_to_val: &Value = &x;\n        eat(&x); // pass by reference, if it's possible\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nstruct Value {}\n\nfn eat(val: Value) {}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = Value{};\n    {\n        let _ref_to_val: &Value = &x;\n    }\n    eat(x); // release borrow and then move it.\n}\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\n#[derive(Clone, Copy)] // implement Copy trait\nstruct Value {}\n\nfn eat(val: Value) {}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = Value{};\n    {\n        let _ref_to_val: &Value = &x;\n        eat(x); // it will be copied here.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can find more information about borrowing in the rust-book:\nhttp://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/references-and-borrowing.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/ariel/Rust/rust-master/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-unary-move.rs","byte_start":599,"byte_end":602,"line_start":16,"line_end":16,"column_start":13,"column_end":16,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    let y = &*x;","highlight_start":13,"highlight_end":16}],"label":"borrow of `*x` occurs here","suggested_replacement":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/home/ariel/Rust/rust-master/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-unary-move.rs","byte_start":613,"byte_end":614,"line_start":17,"line_end":17,"column_start":10,"column_end":11,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    free(x); //[ast]~ ERROR cannot move out of `x` because it is borrowed","highlight_start":10,"highlight_end":11}],"label":"move out of `x` occurs here","suggested_replacement":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"error[E0505]: cannot move out of `x` because it is borrowed\n  --> /home/ariel/Rust/rust-master/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-unary-move.rs:17:10\n   |\n16 |     let y = &*x;\n   |             --- borrow of `*x` occurs here\n17 |     free(x); //[ast]~ ERROR cannot move out of `x` because it is borrowed\n   |          ^ move out of `x` occurs here\n\n"}
