{"message":"borrowed value does not live long enough","code":{"code":"E0597","explanation":"\nThis error occurs because a borrow was made inside a variable which has a\ngreater lifetime than the borrowed one.\n\nExample of erroneous code:\n\n```compile_fail,E0597\nstruct Foo<'a> {\n    x: Option<&'a u32>,\n}\n\nlet mut x = Foo { x: None };\nlet y = 0;\nx.x = Some(&y); // error: `y` does not live long enough\n```\n\nIn here, `x` is created before `y` and therefore has a greater lifetime.
