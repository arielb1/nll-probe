{"message":"`*x` does not live long enough (Ast)","code":{"code":"E0597","explanation":"\nThis error occurs because a borrow was made inside a variable which has a\ngreater lifetime than the borrowed one.\n\nExample of erroneous code:\n\n```compile_fail,E0597\nstruct Foo<'a> {\n    x: Option<&'a u32>,\n}\n\nlet mut x = Foo { x: None };\nlet y = 0;\nx.x = Some(&y); // error: `y` does not live long enough\n```\n\nIn here, `x` is created before `y` and therefore has a greater lifetime. Always\nkeep in mind that values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are\ncreated. So to fix the previous example, just make the `y` lifetime greater than\nthe `x`'s one:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<'a> {\n    x: Option<&'a u32>,\n}\n\nlet y = 0;\nlet mut x = Foo { x: None };\nx.x = Some(&y);\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/ariel/Rust/rust-emergency/src/test/compile-fail/region-object-lifetime-5.rs","byte_start":793,"byte_end":794,"line_start":21,"line_end":21,"column_start":5,"column_end":6,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    x.borrowed() //~ ERROR `*x` does not live long enough","highlight_start":5,"highlight_end":6}],"label":"does not live long enough","suggested_replacement":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/home/ariel/Rust/rust-emergency/src/test/compile-fail/region-object-lifetime-5.rs","byte_start":847,"byte_end":848,"line_start":22,"line_end":22,"column_start":1,"column_end":2,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"}","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":2}],"label":"borrowed value only lives until here","suggested_replacement":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"borrowed value must be valid for the static lifetime...","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":null}
