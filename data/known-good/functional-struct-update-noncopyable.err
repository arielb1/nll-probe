{"message":"cannot move out of type `A`, which implements the `Drop` trait","code":{"code":"E0509","explanation":"\nThis error occurs when an attempt is made to move out of a value whose type\nimplements the `Drop` trait.\n\nExample of erroneous code:\n\n```compile_fail,E0509\nstruct FancyNum {\n    num: usize\n}\n\nstruct DropStruct {\n    fancy: FancyNum\n}\n\nimpl Drop for DropStruct {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        // Destruct DropStruct, possibly using FancyNum\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let drop_struct = DropStruct{fancy: FancyNum{num: 5}};\n    let fancy_field = drop_struct.fancy; // Error E0509\n    println!(\"Fancy: {}\", fancy_field.num);\n    // implicit call to `drop_struct.drop()` as drop_struct goes out of scope\n}\n```\n\nHere, we tried to move a field out of a struct of type `DropStruct` which\nimplements the `Drop` trait. However, a struct cannot be dropped if one or\nmore of its fields have been moved.\n\nStructs implementing the `Drop` trait have an implicit destructor that gets\ncalled when they go out of scope. This destructor may use the fields of the\nstruct, so moving out of the struct could make it impossible to run the\ndestructor. Therefore, we must think of all values whose type implements the\n`Drop` trait as single units whose fields cannot be moved.\n\nThis error can be fixed by creating a reference to the fields of a struct,\nenum, or tuple using the `ref` keyword:\n\n```\nstruct FancyNum {\n    num: usize\n}\n\nstruct DropStruct {\n    fancy: FancyNum\n}\n\nimpl Drop for DropStruct {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        // Destruct DropStruct, possibly using FancyNum\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let drop_struct = DropStruct{fancy: FancyNum{num: 5}};\n    let ref fancy_field = drop_struct.fancy; // No more errors!\n    println!(\"Fancy: {}\", fancy_field.num);\n    // implicit call to `drop_struct.drop()` as drop_struct goes out of scope\n}\n```\n\nNote that this technique can also be used in the arms of a match expression:\n\n```\nstruct FancyNum {\n    num: usize\n}\n\nenum DropEnum {\n    Fancy(FancyNum)\n}\n\nimpl Drop for DropEnum {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        // Destruct DropEnum, possibly using FancyNum\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Creates and enum of type `DropEnum`, which implements `Drop`\n    let drop_enum = DropEnum::Fancy(FancyNum{num: 10});\n    match drop_enum {\n        // Creates a reference to the inside of `DropEnum::Fancy`\n        DropEnum::Fancy(ref fancy_field) => // No error!\n            println!(\"It was fancy-- {}!\", fancy_field.num),\n    }\n    // implicit call to `drop_enum.drop()` as drop_enum goes out of scope\n}\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/ariel/Rust/rust-master/src/test/compile-fail/functional-struct-update-noncopyable.rs","byte_start":700,"byte_end":725,"line_start":22,"line_end":22,"column_start":14,"column_end":39,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    let _b = A { y: Arc::new(3), ..a }; //~ ERROR cannot move out of type `A`","highlight_start":14,"highlight_end":39}],"label":"cannot move out of here","suggested_replacement":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"error[E0509]: cannot move out of type `A`, which implements the `Drop` trait\n  --> /home/ariel/Rust/rust-master/src/test/compile-fail/functional-struct-update-noncopyable.rs:22:14\n   |\n22 |     let _b = A { y: Arc::new(3), ..a }; //~ ERROR cannot move out of type `A`\n   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot move out of here\n\n"}
