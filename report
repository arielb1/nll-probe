diagnostics:

uninitiaized ~ moved out of (45363)

unassigned:
〈unassigned〉: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `y`, which is owned by the current function ~ cannot assign to `y` because it is borrowed (regions-nested-fns-2)
〈unassigned〉: cannot move out of borrowed_content ~ cannot move out of borrowed content / cannot move out of dereference of raw pointer (issue-20801)
〈unassigned〉: cannot move out of borrowed_content ~ cannot move out of captured outer variable in an `FnMut` closure
